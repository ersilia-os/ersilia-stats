This streamlines complex molecular design tasks by facilitating autoregressive generation under various constraints. The effectiveness of SAFE is demonstrated by training a GPT2-like model on a dataset of 1.1 billion SAFE representations that exhibited versatile and robust optimization performance for molecular design.
