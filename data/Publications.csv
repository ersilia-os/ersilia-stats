rec3CxFV9dLqTXr8G,2021-08-30T19:52:05.000Z,"In the era of systems biology, multi-target pharmacological strategies hold promise for tackling disease-related networks. In this regard, drug promiscuity may be leveraged to interfere with multiple receptors: the so-called polypharmacology of drugs can be anticipated by analyzing the similarity of binding sites across the proteome. Here, we perform a pairwise comparison of 90,000 putative binding pockets detected in 3,700 proteins, and find that 23,000 pairs of proteins have at least one similar cavity that could, in principle, accommodate similar ligands. By inspecting these pairs, we demonstrate how the detection of similar binding sites expands the space of opportunities for the rational design of drug polypharmacology. Finally, we illustrate how to leverage these opportunities in protein-protein interaction networks related to several therapeutic classes and tumor types, and in a genome-scale metabolic model of leukemia.

In particular, transcriptional signatures of drug sensitivity may guide drug repositioning, prioritize drug combinations, and point to new therapeutic biomarkers. However, the inherent complexity of transcriptional signatures, with thousands of differentially expressed genes, makes them hard to interpret, thus giving poor mechanistic insights and hampering translation to clinics. To simplify drug signatures, we have developed a network-based methodology to identify functionally coherent gene modules. Our strategy starts with the calculation of drug-gene correlations and is followed by a pathway-oriented filtering and a network-diffusion analysis across the interactome. We apply …

We postulated that this data can be mined to define chemical features associated with sole ABS activity and/or those that provide additional life cycle activity profiles like gametocytocidal activity. Additionally, this information could provide chemical features associated with inactive compounds, which could eliminate any future unnecessary screening of similar chemical analogues. Therefore, we aimed to use machine learning to identify the chemical space associated with stage-specific antimalarial activity. We collected data from various chemical libraries that were screened against the asexual (126 374 compounds) and sexual (gametocyte) stages of the parasite (93 941 compounds), calculated the compounds’ molecular fingerprints and trained machine learning models to recognize stage-specific active and inactiv compounds. We were able to build several models that predicts compound activity against ABS and dual-activity against ABS and gametocytes, with Support Vector Machines (SVM) showing superior abilities with high recall (90% and 66%) and low false positive predictions (15% and 1%). This allowed identification of chemical features enriched in active and inactive populations, an important outcome that could be mined for essential chemical features to streamline hit-to-lead optimization strategies of antimalarial candidates. The predictive capabilities of the models held true in diverse chemical spaces, indicating that the ML models are therefore robust and can serve as a prioritization tool to drive and guide phenotypic screening and medicinal chemistry programs.

The 23 invited speakers of this year’s workshop also came from academia and industry and 222 registered participants from five continents (Africa, Asia, Europe, South, and North America) took part in the workshop. The workshop highlighted the potential applications of computational methodologies in the search for secondary metabolites or natural products as drug candidates and drug leads. For three days, the participants of this online workshop discussed modern computer-based approaches for exploring NP discovery in the “omics” age. The invited experts gave keynote lectures, trained participants in hands-on sessions, and held round table discussions. These were followed by oral presentations during which much interaction between the speakers and the audience was observed. Selected applicants (early-career scientists) were offered the opportunity to give oral presentations (15 min) upon submission of an abstract. The final program available on the workshop website (<https://indiayouth.info/index.php/caismd>) comprised three keynote lectures, 14 oral presentations, two round table discussions, and four hands-on sessions.

In this study, we leveraged these datasets to create predictive models of cancer cells drug sensitivity. To this aim we trained explainable machine learning algorithms by employing cell line transcriptomics to predict the growth inhibitory potential of drugs. We used large language models (LLMs) to expand descriptions of the mechanisms of action (MOA) for each drug starting from available annotations, which were matched to the semantically closest pathways from reference knowledge bases. By leveraging this AI-curated resource, and the interpretability of our model, we demonstrated that pathways enriched for genes crucial for prediction often matched known drug-MOAs and essential genes, suggesting that our models learned the molecular determinants of drug response. Furthermore, we demonstrated that by incorporating only LLM-curated genes associated with MOAs, we enhanced the predictive accuracy of our drug models. To enhance translatability to a clinical setting, we employed a pipeline to align bulk RNAseq from CCLs, used for training the models, to those from patient samples, used for inference. We proved the effectiveness of our approach on TCGA samples, where patients best scoring drugs matched those prescribed for their cancer type. We further showed its usefulness by predicting and experimentally validating effective drugs for the patients of two highly lethal solid tumors, i.e. pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma. In summary, our method facilitates the inference and interpretation of cancer cell line drug sensitivity and holds potential to effectively translate them into new cancer therapeutics.

Routine laboratory tests of serum creatinine have been conducted to assess HIV treatment (ART) suitability. Here we utilize those measures to assess kidney function impairment among those initiating ART. Identification of non-communicable disease (NCD) risks among those in HIV care creates opportunity to improve public health through care referral and/or NCD/HIV care integration. We estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) using routinely collected serum creatinine measures among a cohort of PLHIV with an HIV care visit at one of 113 Centre for Infectious Disease Research Zambia (CIDRZ) supported sites between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2017, across seven of the ten provinces in Zambia. We used mixed-effect Poisson regression to assess predictors of eGFR <60ml/min/1.73m2 allowing random effects at the individual and facility level. Additionally, we assessed agreement between four eGFR formulae with unadjusted CKD-EPI as a standard using Scott/Fleiss method across five categories of kidney function. A total of 72,933 observations among 68,534 individuals met the inclusion criteria for analysis. Of the 68,534, the majority were female 41,042 (59.8%), the median age was 34 (interquartile range [IQR]: 28–40), and median CD4 cell count was 292 (IQR: 162–435). The proportion of individuals with an eGFR <60ml/min/1.73m2 was 6.9% (95% CI: 6.7–7.1%) according to the unadjusted CKD-EPI equation. There was variation in agreement across eGFR formulas considered compared to unadjusted CKD-EPI (χ2 p-value <0.001). Estimated GFR less than 60ml/min/1.73m2, per the unadjusted CKD-EPI equation, was significantly associated with age, sex, body mass index, and blood pressure. Using routine serum creatinine measures, we identified a significant proportion of individuals with eGFR indicating moderate or great kidney function impairment among PLHIV initiating ART in Zambia. It is possible that differentiated service delivery models could be developed to address this subset of those in HIV care with increased risk of chronic kidney disease.

Here we present a collection of deep neural networks able to infer bioactivity signatures for any compound of interest, even when little or no experimental information is available for them.

Indeed, we illustrate how inferred bioactivity signatures are useful to navigate the chemical space in a biologically relevant manner, unveiling higher-order organization in natural product collections, and to enrich mostly uncharacterized chemical libraries for activity against the drug-orphan target Snail1.

Over fifty years of intense research have revealed many key elements of the biology of this neurodegenerative disorder. However, our understanding of the molecular bases of the disease is still incomplete, and the medical treatments available for AD are mainly symptomatic and hardly effective. Indeed, the robustness of biological systems has revealed that the modulation of a single target is unlikely to yield the desired outcome and we should therefore move from gene-centric to systemic therapeutic strategies. Here we present the complete characterization of three murine models of AD at different stages of the disease (i.e. onset, progression and advanced). To identify genotype-to-phenotype relationships, we combine the cognitive assessment of these mice with histological analyses and full transcriptional and protein quantification profiling of the hippocampus. Comparison of the gene and protein expression trends observed in AD progression and physiological aging revealed certain commonalities, such as the upregulation of microglial and inflammation markers. However, although AD models show accelerated aging, other factors specifically associated with Aβ pathology are involved. Despite the clear correlation between mRNA and protein levels of the dysregulated genes, we discovered a few proteins whose abundance increases with AD progression, while the corresponding transcript levels remain stable.

The tool has been implemented end-to-end at the Holistic Drug Discovery and Development (H3D) Centre, the leading integrated drug discovery unit in Africa, at which no prior AI/ML capabilities were available. We have exploited in-house data collected from over a decade of drug discovery research in malaria and tuberculosis and built models to predict the outcomes of 15 key checkpoint assays. We subsequently deployed these models as a virtual screening cascade at an organisational scale to increase the hit rate of current experimental assays. We show how computational profiling of compounds, prior to synthesis and experimental testing, can increase the rate of progression by up to 40%. Moreover, we demonstrate that the approach can be applied to prioritise small molecules within a chemical series and to assess the likelihood of success of novel chemotypes, promoting efficient usage of limited experimental resources. This project is part of a first-of-its-kind collaboration between the H3D Centre, a research centre operating in a low-resource setting, and the Ersilia Open Source Initiative, a young tech non-profit devoted to building data science capacity in the Global South.

recSHYNlBeXfPqo2A,2023-09-07T13:27:27.000Z,"Severe anemia is an important contributor to mortality in children with severe malaria. Anemia in malaria is a multi-factorial complication, since dyserythropoiesis, hemolysis and phagocytic clearance of uninfected red blood cells (RBCs) can contribute to this syndrome. High levels of oxidative stress and immune dysregulation have been proposed to contribute to severe malarial anemia, facilitating the clearance of uninfected RBCs. In a cohort of 552 Ugandan children with severe malaria, we measured the levels of xanthine oxidase (XO), an oxidative enzyme that is elevated in the plasma of malaria patients. The levels of XO in children with severe anemia were significantly higher compared to children with severe malaria not suffering from severe anemia. Levels of XO were inversely associated with RBC hemoglobin (ρ = − 0.25, _p_ < 0.0001), indicating a relation between this enzyme and severe anemia. When compared with the levels of immune complexes and of autoimmune antibodies to phosphatidylserine, factors previously associated with severe anemia in malaria patients, we observed that XO is not associated with them, suggesting that XO is associated with severe anemia through an independent mechanism. XO was associated with prostration, acidosis, jaundice, respiratory distress, and kidney injury, which may reflect a broader relation of this enzyme with severe malaria pathology. Since inhibitors of XO are inexpensive and well-tolerated drugs already approved for use in humans, the validation of XO as a contributor to severe malarial anemia and other malaria complications may open new possibilities for much needed adjunctive therapy in malaria.

The increasing availability of bioactivity data has improved compound representations to include biological effects, although bioactivity descriptors are often limited to a few well-documented molecules. To address this issue, we implemented a collection of deep neural networks able to leverage the experimentally determined bioactivity data associated to small molecules and infer the missing bioactivity signatures for any compound of interest. However, unlike static chemical descriptors, these bioactivity signatures dynamically evolve with new data and processing strategies. Here, we present a computational protocol to modify or generate novel bioactivity spaces and signatures, describing the main steps needed to leverage diverse bioactivity data with the current knowledge, as catalogued in the Chemical Checker (CC), using the predefined data curation pipeline. We illustrate the functioning of the protocol through four specific examples, including the incorporation of new compounds to an already existing bioactivity space, a change in the data pre-processing without altering the underlying experimental data, and the creation of two novel bioactivity spaces from scratch, which are completed in under 9 hours using GPU computing. Overall, this protocol offers a guideline for installing, testing and running the CC data integration approach on user-provided data, with the aim of extending the annotation presented for a limited number of small molecules to a larger chemical landscape.

Emerging artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) methods can accelerate anti-infective drug discovery and have the potential to reduce overall development costs in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC), which in turn may help to develop new and/or accessible therapies against communicable diseases within these countries. While the marketplace currently offers a plethora of data-driven AI/ML tools, most to date have been developed within the context of non-communicable diseases like cancer, and several barriers have limited the translation of existing tools to the discovery of drugs against infectious diseases. Here, we provide a perspective on the benefits, limitations, and pitfalls of AI/ML tools in the discovery of novel therapeutics with a focus on antivirals. We also discuss available and emerging data sharing models including intellectual property-preserving AI/ML. In addition, we review available data sources and platforms and provide examples for low-cost and accessible screening methods and other virus-based bioassays suitable for implementation of AI/ML-based programs in LMICs. Finally, we introduce an emerging AI/ML-based Center in Cameroon (Central Africa) which is currently developing methods and tools to promote local, independent drug discovery and represents a model that could be replicated among LMIC globally.

However, the unspecificity of early symptoms often makes difficult to identify patients at high-risk of developing severe disease. Additionally, one of the most feared malaria complications -cerebral malaria- is challenging to diagnose, often resulting in treatment delays that can lead to adverse outcomes.To identify candidate biomarkers for the prognosis and/or diagnosis of severe and cerebral malaria, we have analyzed the transcriptomic response of human brain microvascular endothelial cells to erythrocytes infected with _Plasmodium falciparum_. Candidates were validated in plasma samples from a cohort of malaria pediatric patients from Mozambique (_n_ = 264), resulting in the identification of several markers with capacity to distinguish uncomplicated from severe malaria, the most potent being the metallopeptidase ADAMTS18 (AUC = 0.77, _P_ < 0.0001). Two other biomarkers, Angiopoietin-like-4 and Inhibin-βE were able to differentiate children with cerebral malaria within the severe malaria group, showing increased sensitivity after combination in a biomarker signature (AUC = 0.76, _P_ < 0.0001).The validation of the predicted candidate biomarkers in plasma of children with severe and cerebral malaria underscores the power of this transcriptomic approach and indicates that a specific endothelial response to _P. falciparum_-infected erythrocytes is linked to the pathophysiology of severe malaria.

Although there is a wealth of literature suggesting best practices for the use and development of predictive models, they focus on checking the model correctness [[6](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012731#pcbi.1012731.ref006)], establishing the correct mathematical approaches [[1](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012731#pcbi.1012731.ref001)], adopting good simulation workflows [[2](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012731#pcbi.1012731.ref002)], properly storing and manipulating data [[7](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012731#pcbi.1012731.ref007),[8](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012731#pcbi.1012731.ref008)], or ensuring that our work with data, and anything downstream of this work, is ethical [[9](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012731#pcbi.1012731.ref009)].

recuB58gmFAcIj6K9,2021-08-30T20:00:15.000Z,"Structural systems pharmacology offers a novel way of approaching drug discovery by considering the global physiological environment of protein targets, and the effects derived of tinkering with them, without losing the key molecular details. In this article, we review some recent advances in the structural annotation of cell networks and discuss their potential impact on some of the hottest areas of drug development. In particular, we analyze recent structure-based strategies to target networks, protein interaction interfaces and allosteric sites, and how they will help in the development of more potent and specific treatments. Finally, we propose that mapping genetic variations onto protein networks, beyond the pharmacological targets, can rationalize interindividual variability in drug response, giving valuable hints to advance toward personalized medicine.

recxpVNtrpI7x7UDE,2024-08-01T15:01:16.000Z,"The discovery of treatments for infectious diseases that affect the poorest countries has been stagnant for decades. As long as expected returns on investment remain low, pharmaceutical companies’ lack of interest in this disease area must be compensated for with collaborative efforts from the public sector. New approaches to drug discovery, inspired by the “open source” philosophy prevalent in software development, offer a platform for experts from diverse backgrounds to contribute their skills, enhancing reproducibility, progress tracking, and public discussion. Here, we present the first efforts of Ersilia, an initiative focused on implementing data science in global health, towards meeting the goals of Open Source Malaria, a consortium of medicinal chemists investigating antimalarial compounds using a purely open science approach. We showcase the chemical space exploration of a set of triazolopyrazine compounds with potent antiplasmodial activity, and discuss how open source practices can serve as a common ground to make drug discovery more inclusive and participative.

recy9NkmfbF4wRgnA,2024-11-02T18:58:26.000Z,"Diseases caused by viruses are challenging to contain, as their outbreak and spread could be very sudden, compounded by rapid mutations, making the development of drugs and vaccines a continued endeavour that requires fast discovery and preparedness. Targeting viral infections with small molecules remains one of the treatment options to reduce transmission and the disease burden. A lesson learned from the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is to collect ready-to-screen small molecule libraries in preparation for the next viral outbreak, and potentially find a clinical candidate before it becomes a pandemic. Public availability of diverse compound libraries, well annotated in terms of chemical structures and scaffolds, modes of action, and bioactivities are, therefore, crucial to ensure participation of academic laboratories in these screening efforts, especially in resource-limited settings where synthesis, testing and computing capacity are scarce. Here, we demonstrate a low-resource approach to  populate the chemical space of naturally occurring and synthetic small molecules that have shown _in vitro_ and/or _in vivo_ activities against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its target proteins. We have manually curated two datasets of small molecules (naturally occurring and synthetically derived) by reading and collecting (hand-curating) the published literature. Information from the literature reveals that a majority of the reported SARS-CoV-2 compounds act by inhibiting the main protease, while 25% of the compounds currently have no known target. Scaffold analysis and principal component analysis revealed that the most common scaffolds in the datasets are quite distinct. We then expanded the initially manually curated dataset of over 1200 compounds _via_ an ultra-large scale 2D and 3D similarity search, obtaining an expanded collection of over 150k purchasable compounds. The spanned chemical space significantly extends beyond that of a commercially-available coronavirus library of more than 20k small molecules, and constitutes a good starting collection for virtual screening campaigns given its manageable size and proximity to hand-curated compounds.
